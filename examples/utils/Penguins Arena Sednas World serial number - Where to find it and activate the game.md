The game's premise is that the penguin tribes are endangered by global warming, melting ice caps, and pollution. Sedna, the ancient Penguin Goddess, tells them that there is room for only one tribe on the planet. And so the battle begins. The player controls a penguin who must join the snowball fight and knock the other penguins off the icebergs. The game features four unique game modes, multiplayer support, penguin customization, and 10 in-game achievements.
 
One of the most interesting aspects of the game is the magic of reincarnation. When the player's penguin dies, it can return to the game as a ghost and possess another penguin from its tribe. This way, the player can influence the outcome of the battle even in the afterlife. The game also allows player interaction after death, such as chatting with other ghosts or throwing snowballs at living penguins.
