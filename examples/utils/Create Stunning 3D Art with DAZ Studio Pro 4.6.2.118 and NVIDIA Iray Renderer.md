## ERC Freeze
 
Another useful feature that DAZ Studio Pro 4.6.2.118 offers is ERC Freeze. ERC stands for Extended Remote Control, which is a way of linking properties of different objects in your scene. For example, you can link the rotation of a wheel to the movement of a car, or the expression of a face to the pose of a body.
 
ERC Freeze allows you to freeze or unfreeze these links at any time, giving you more control over your scene. You can use it to create custom morphs, adjust poses, fix poke-through issues, or make other changes without affecting the linked properties.
 
To use ERC Freeze, select an object in your scene and go to Edit > Object > ERC Freeze in the menu bar. You will see a dialog box that lets you choose which properties you want to freeze or unfreeze.
 
## Transfer Utility
 
If you want to transfer shapes, rigging, weight maps, or other properties from one object to another, you can use the Transfer Utility feature in DAZ Studio Pro 4.6.2.118. This is especially useful if you want to use custom characters or clothing items that are not compatible with the Genesis platform.
 
To use the Transfer Utility, go to Edit > Object > Transfer Utility in the menu bar. You will see a dialog box that lets you choose the source object and the target object, as well as the options for transferring properties.
 
## Weight Map Brush
 
One of the most powerful tools in DAZ Studio Pro 4.6.2.118 is the Weight Map Brush. This tool allows you to paint weight maps on your objects, which control how they deform when posed or animated.
 
Weight maps are essential for creating realistic movements and expressions for your characters and clothing items. You can use the Weight Map Brush to create custom weight maps, edit existing ones, or smooth out any issues.
 
To use the Weight Map Brush, select an object in your scene and go to Tools > Weight Map Brush in the menu bar. You will see a toolbar that lets you choose the brush size, strength, mode, and other options.
 
## Conclusion
 
These are just some of the features and improvements that DAZ Studio Pro 4.6.2.118 offers. There are many more that you can explore and experiment with, such as Rigidity Groups, HD Morph limit, FBX export fixes, default menu updates, and more.
