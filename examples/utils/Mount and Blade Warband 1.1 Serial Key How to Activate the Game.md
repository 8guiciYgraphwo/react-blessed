## Method 5: Improve Your Gameplay Skills
 
Once you have your serial key and can play the game without any problems, you may want to improve your gameplay skills and become a better warlord. There are many tips and tricks that can help you achieve this goal, such as:

- Mod your game. As mentioned before, mods can enhance your game experience by adding new features, content, graphics, or gameplay mechanics. Some mods can also make the game more challenging or realistic, such as Floris Mod Pack or Prophesy of Pendor.
- Choose your character wisely. Your character creation choices will affect your gameplay style and difficulty. For example, choosing a noble background will give you more starting renown and relations with lords, but also more enemies. Choosing a female character will make it harder to become a lord or a king, but also more rewarding.
- Do tournaments in the early game. Tournaments are a great way to earn money, reputation, and equipment in the early game. You can also use them to improve your combat skills and learn how to use different weapons and mounts.
- Mercenary or lord? It's up to you. You can choose to join a faction as a mercenary or a lord, or remain independent. Each option has its pros and cons. As a mercenary, you can fight for any faction without losing reputation with others, but you will also have less influence and rewards. As a lord, you can own fiefs and recruit troops from them, but you will also have to deal with politics and wars. As an independent warlord, you can do whatever you want, but you will also face more enemies and challenges.
- Right to rule. This is a measure of how legitimate your claim to the throne is. If you want to start your own kingdom, you need to have enough right to rule, otherwise other factions will not recognize you and declare war on you. You can increase your right to rule by sending companions on missions, getting married, making peace treaties, or helping claimants.
- Make friends with lords. Lords are the key to success in Mount and Blade Warband. They can help you in battles, give you quests, offer you fiefs, or join your kingdom. You can improve your relations with lords by fighting alongside them, completing their tasks, rescuing them from captivity, or giving them gifts.
- Raiding and pillaging. This is a risky but profitable way to make money and weaken your enemies. You can raid villages or caravans of other factions to loot their goods and sell them for profit. However, this will also lower your honor and relations with the owners of the villages or caravans.
- Establish some passive income. Having a steady source of income is essential for maintaining your army and expanding your realm. You can invest in enterprises in towns that will produce goods and pay you weekly profits. You can also own fiefs that will generate taxes and resources for you.
- Damage types. Different weapons deal different types of damage: piercing (arrows, spears), cutting (swords), or blunt (maces). Each type has its advantages and disadvantages against different types of armor and enemies. For example, piercing weapons are good against heavy armor but bad against shields; cutting weapons are good against light armor but bad against helmets; blunt weapons are good against shields but bad against horses.
- Couched lance damage. This is a special type of damage that is dealt by lances when they are lowered while 8cf37b1e13
