Wi-Fi networks are everywhere, but they are not always secure. If you want to test the security of your own network or access a nearby one, you might need to crack the Wi-Fi password using a dictionary wordlist. A dictionary wordlist is a collection of passwords and wordlists commonly used for dictionary-attacks using a variety of password cracking tools such as aircrack-ng, hydra and hashcat.

A dictionary attack is a type of brute force attack that tries to guess the password by using a list of words or phrases that are likely to be used as passwords. The advantage of this method is that it can be faster than trying every possible combination of characters, especially if the password is weak or common. The disadvantage is that it relies on the quality and size of the wordlist, and it might not work if the password is complex or random.
 
In this article, we will show you how to crack WPA WEP WPA2 Wi-Fi passwords using dictionary wordlists. We will use a tool called aircrack-ng, which is a suite of tools for wireless network auditing and penetration testing. Aircrack-ng can capture and analyze Wi-Fi packets, perform deauthentication attacks, crack WEP and WPA/WPA2 passwords, and more.
 
## Requirements
 
To follow this tutorial, you will need:
 
- A computer with a wireless network adapter that supports monitor mode and packet injection. You can check if your adapter supports these features by running `airmon-ng` in a terminal.
- A Linux operating system with aircrack-ng installed. You can install aircrack-ng from your package manager or from the official website: [https://www.aircrack-ng.org/](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/)
- A dictionary wordlist file. You can download one from the internet or create your own using tools like crunch or cewl. One example of a wordlist repository is [https://github.com/kennyn510/wpa2-wordlists](https://github.com/kennyn510/wpa2-wordlists)
- A target Wi-Fi network that uses WEP, WPA or WPA2 encryption. You should only perform this attack on networks that you own or have permission to test.

## Steps
 
Here are the steps to crack WPA WEP WPA2 Wi-Fi passwords using dictionary wordlists:

1. Put your wireless adapter in monitor mode. Monitor mode allows your adapter to capture all the wireless traffic in the air, regardless of the network or encryption. To do this, run `airmon-ng start wlan0`, where wlan0 is the name of your wireless interface. This will create a new interface called wlan0mon that is in monitor mode.
2. Scan for nearby Wi-Fi networks. To do this, run `airodump-ng wlan0mon`, where wlan0mon is the name of your monitor mode interface. This will display a list of networks with their BSSID (MAC address), ESSID (network name), channel, encryption type, signal strength, and number of clients connected.
3. Select your target network and note down its BSSID, channel, and encryption type. For example, if you want to crack the password of a network called "MyWiFi" that uses WPA2 encryption and operates on channel 6, you would note down its BSSID (e.g., 00:11:22:33:44:55), channel (6), and encryption type (WPA2).
4. Capture the handshake between the access point and a client. The handshake is a four-way exchange of cryptographic keys that occurs when a client connects to a Wi-Fi network. The handshake contains enough information to crack the password using a dictionary attack. To capture the handshake, run `airodump-ng -c 6 --bssid 00:11:22:33:44:55 -w output wlan0mon`, where -c 6 specifies the channel, --bssid 00:11:22:33: 8cf37b1e13
