If you have a Samsung Clone J3 Pro MT6580 smartphone that has a dead display problem, you may be looking for a way to fix it. A dead display problem means that your phone's screen is either black or white, and you cannot see anything on it. This can be caused by various reasons, such as a faulty LCD, a damaged motherboard, a corrupted firmware, or a virus infection.
 
One of the possible solutions to fix this problem is to flash your phone with a new firmware. A firmware is a software that controls the basic functions of your phone, such as booting up, displaying images, and communicating with other devices. By flashing your phone with a new firmware, you can overwrite the corrupted or infected firmware and restore your phone's normal functions.
