Tool - 10,000 Days [FLAC] is a great album to listen to if you appreciate the artistry and creativity of Tool. The album explores various themes such as mortality, spirituality, and personal growth. The album also features some hidden messages and synchronicities that can be discovered by playing certain tracks simultaneously or in a different order. For example, if you play the tracks "Wings for Marie (Pt 1)" and "10,000 Days (Wings Pt 2)" together, you will hear a third song that is not on the album. This song is called "Viginti Tres", which means 23 in Latin. The number 23 is significant for Tool as it is related to the occult and numerology.
 
Another example of a hidden message is the title of the album itself. 10,000 Days refers to the approximate length of time that Maynard James Keenan's mother was paralyzed after suffering a stroke. She died in 2003, and the album is dedicated to her memory. The album cover also features a pair of stereoscopic glasses that can be used to view the artwork in 3D. The artwork was created by Alex Grey, a visionary artist who has collaborated with Tool on several occasions.
 
If you want to experience Tool - 10,000 Days [FLAC] in a deeper and more immersive way, you can try using headphones or a surround sound system. You can also read the lyrics and analyze the meanings behind them. You can also watch some of the music videos that Tool has released for this album, such as "Vicarious" and "The Pot".
