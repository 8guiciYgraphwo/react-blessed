If you are using Windows 7 on a 32 bit system, you may encounter a common error message that says "BOOTMGR is missing". This means that your computer cannot find the boot manager file (bootmgr.efi) that is responsible for loading the operating system. This can happen due to various reasons, such as corrupt or misconfigured files, hard drive issues, outdated BIOS, or loose cables. Fortunately, there are some ways to fix this problem and download the bootmgr.efi file for your system.
 
## What is Bootmgr Efi?
 
Bootmgr.efi is the Windows UEFI bootloader file that is located in the EFI system partition of your hard drive. UEFI stands for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, which is a modern replacement for the traditional BIOS. UEFI provides more features and security than BIOS, such as faster boot times, support for larger hard drives, and protection from malware. Bootmgr.efi is responsible for loading the winload.efi file, which then loads the rest of the Windows operating system.

## How to Download Windows 7 Bootmgr Efi for 32 Bit
 
If you need to download the bootmgr.efi file for your Windows 7 32 bit system, you can use one of the following methods:
 
- Use a Windows installation disc or USB drive. Insert the disc or drive into your computer and boot from it. Choose your language and keyboard layout, then click "Repair your computer". Select your Windows installation and click "Next". Click "Startup Repair" and follow the instructions. This will automatically scan and fix any problems with your boot files, including bootmgr.efi.
- Use a recovery tool or software. There are some third-party tools or software that can help you download and fix bootmgr.efi for your system. For example, you can use Easy Recovery Essentials (https://neosmart.net/EasyRE/), which is a bootable CD or USB that can repair various Windows issues. You can also use Boot-Repair-Disk (https://sourceforge.net/projects/boot-repair-cd/), which is a Linux-based tool that can fix common boot problems.
- Use another working computer. If you have access to another computer that has the same version of Windows 7 as yours, you can copy the bootmgr.efi file from it and paste it into your EFI system partition. To do this, you need to connect your hard drive to the other computer using a SATA to USB adapter or enclosure. Then, open File Explorer and enable hidden files and folders. Navigate to C:\Windows\Boot\EFI\ and copy the bootmgr.efi file. Next, connect your hard drive back to your original computer and boot from it. Open File Explorer again and navigate to the EFI system partition (usually labeled as SYSTEM). Paste the bootmgr.efi file into it and overwrite the existing one.
