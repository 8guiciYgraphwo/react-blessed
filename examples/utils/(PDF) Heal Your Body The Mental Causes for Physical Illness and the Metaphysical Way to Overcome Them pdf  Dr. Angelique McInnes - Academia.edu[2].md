One of the most popular and effective ways to use affirmations is to follow the teachings of Louise Hay, who wrote the book *I Can Do It: How to Use Affirmations to Change Your Life*. In this book, which you can also listen to on the included audio download, Louise explains that every thought you think and every word you speak is an affirmation. Even your self-talk, your internal dialogue, is a stream of affirmations. Youâre affirming and creating your life experiences with every word and thought.
 
Louise also explains that your beliefs are merely habitual thinking patterns that you learned as a child, and many of them work very well for you. But other beliefs may be limiting your ability to create the very things you say you want. You need to pay attention to your thoughts so that you can begin to eliminate the ones creating experiences that you donât want.
 
As Louise discusses topics such as health, forgiveness, prosperity, creativity, relationships, job success, and self-esteem, youâll see that affirmations are solutions that will replace whatever problem you might have in a particular area. For example, if you have a health issue, you can use affirmations such as "I am healthy and strong" or "My body heals quickly and easily". If you have a financial issue, you can use affirmations such as "I am prosperous and abundant" or "Money flows to me effortlessly". If you have a relationship issue, you can use affirmations such as "I am loved and accepted" or "I attract loving and supportive people into my life".
 
Louise suggests that you repeat your affirmations several times a day, preferably in front of a mirror. You can also write them down, say them aloud, or listen to them on audio. The more you repeat them, the more they will sink into your subconscious mind and become your new reality. Louise also recommends that you use positive words and phrases in your affirmations, and avoid using negative words such as "no", "not", "don't", or "can't". For example, instead of saying "I don't want to be sick", say "I want to be healthy". Instead of saying "I can't afford this", say "I can afford this".
 
Another important tip from Louise is to use affirmations in the present tense, as if they are already true. This way, you are telling your subconscious mind that this is how things are now, not how they will be in the future. For example, instead of saying "I will be happy", say "I am happy". Instead of saying "I will find a good job", say "I have a good job". By using affirmations in the present tense, you are aligning yourself with the vibration of what you want and attracting it into your life.
