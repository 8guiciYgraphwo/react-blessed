Heat treatment is a process of applying controlled heating and cooling to metals and alloys to alter their physical and mechanical properties. Heat treatment can improve the strength, hardness, ductility, toughness, wear resistance, corrosion resistance, and other characteristics of metals. Heat treatment can also be used to relieve internal stresses, refine the grain structure, and modify the phase composition of metals.

Heat treatment is a complex and dynamic process that involves many variables and factors. Some of the important factors that affect the outcome of heat treatment are the composition and microstructure of the metal, the heating and cooling rates, the temperature and time of holding, the type and condition of the furnace, the atmosphere and environment, and the quenching medium and method. To achieve the desired results, heat treatment requires careful planning, design, execution, monitoring, and control.
 
Heat Treatment: Principles and Techniques by Rajan and Sharma provides a systematic and comprehensive approach to understand and apply heat treatment. The book explains the fundamental concepts and principles of heat treatment, such as phase diagrams, diffusion, transformation kinetics, hardenability, residual stresses, and thermomechanical treatment. The book also describes the various heat treatment processes, such as annealing, normalizing, hardening, tempering, austempering, martempering, case hardening, nitriding, carburizing, cyaniding, carbonitriding, induction hardening, flame hardening, laser hardening, and surface hardening. The book also discusses the effects of heat treatment on the properties and performance of metals and alloys. The book also provides practical guidelines and examples for selecting the appropriate heat treatment parameters and methods for different applications.
