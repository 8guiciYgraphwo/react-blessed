Modern Talking was formed in 1984 by Dieter Bohlen and Thomas Anders, two German musicians who had previously worked together as songwriters and producers. Their first single, "You're My Heart, You're My Soul", was an instant hit across Europe and reached number one in 35 countries. They followed it up with more successful singles such as "You Can Win If You Want", "Cheri Cheri Lady", "Brother Louie", and "Atlantis Is Calling (S.O.S. For Love)".
 
Modern Talking's music was influenced by disco, new wave, and synth-pop genres, and featured catchy hooks, simple lyrics, and high-pitched vocals. They sold over 120 million records worldwide and became one of the best-selling German acts of all time. They also won several awards, including a World Music Award, a Golden Europe Award, and a Bambi Award.
