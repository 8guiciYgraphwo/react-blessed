## Step 1: Download the Battle Stadium D.O.N Remastered HD Texture Pack
 
The Battle Stadium D.O.N Remastered HD Texture Pack was created by Hipnosis183, a user on the Dolphin forums. He used a sophisticated filter to improve the quality of the original textures, and also translated some of the menus and HUD elements to English. You can download the texture pack from this link[^2^]. The file size is about 213 MB.
 
## Step 2: Extract the Texture Pack to Your Game Directory
 
After downloading the texture pack, you will need to extract it to your game directory. If you are using a modded GameCube or Wii, you will need to copy the extracted folder to your SD card or USB drive. If you are using Dolphin, you will need to copy the extracted folder to your Dolphin Emulator\Load\Textures directory.
 
The extracted folder should have the name G8SJAF. This is the game ID for Battle Stadium D.O.N on GameCube. Make sure that the folder name matches the game ID exactly, otherwise the texture pack will not load.
